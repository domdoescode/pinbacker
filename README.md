A Node.js controlled server provisioning system, used to abstract cloud instances away from their hosting providers.

This project is still being planned, so this page will mostly serve as a notes board for now. Any suggestions, feel free to fork and pull request them in.

* Provisioning for different providers (Amazon EC2, ElasticHosts, etc).
* Simple configuration in yml.
* REST URL routes for common API tasks.
* Web interface for 'at a glance' cloud information.
